            <h1>Board with Friends</h1>
            <p>Snowboarding Club is about snowboarding and making friends.We're a unique type of club in that we meet on the mountain and are shamelessly about having a good time on the snow and making sure those around us have an awesome time too.</p>
            <h2>Snowboarding is Community</h2>
            <p>The Snowboarding Club philosophy is about creating community. When snow season arrives, it's often difficult to coordinate trips to the mountain with your friends. Snowboarding Club means you'll always have buddies on the mountain.</p>
